| Pentagon                | 1  | ah   | oh   | 4      | 7 / k    | g       | ng      |
| Hexagon                 | 2  | eee  | oo   | 5      | 8        | 10 / h  | oy      |
| Octagon                 | 3  | eh   | uh   | 6      | 9        |         |         |

Please note that I added `oy` to the table, as the closest would have been a combination from `oh` and `iy`.
